I am a husband and father of two great daughters and two great step-daughters. I work for a computer software company in the Charlotte area as an Infrastructure Engineer. Born, raised, and having lived in North Carolina all my life, I graduated from N.C. State University what seems like ages ago.

As this is a personal website, I'll be discussing things that interest me. Those things are, in no particular order, technology, sports, and politics. I am very opinionated and intend on using this website as an outlet. Nothing is meant to offend, though I'm sure that is bound to happen.
