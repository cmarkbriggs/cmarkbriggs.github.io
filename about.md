I am a husband and father of two great daughters and two great step-daughters. Until recently, I worked for a computer software company in the Charlotte area as an Infrastructure Engineer. Like many, I was laid off as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 26 years with the same company, I'm both nervous and anxious about the next chapter of my career.

Born, raised, and having lived in North Carolina all my life, I graduated from N.C. State University what seems like ages ago. I love all things Wolfpack and root for anyone competing against the Tar Heels. I have recently become a fan of English Premiere League football and am now a big Leicester City fan.

As this is a personal website, I'll be discussing things that interest me. Those things are, in no particular order, technology, sports, and politics. I am very opinionated and intend on using this website as an outlet. Nothing is meant to offend, though I'm sure that is bound to happen.
