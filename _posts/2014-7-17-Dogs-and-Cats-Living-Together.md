Apple and IBM's [announcement yesterday](http://9to5mac.com/2014/07/15/apple-announces-huge-ibm-partnership-to-bring-enterprise-services-to-ios-new-applecare-for-enterprise/) of an enterprise partnership is great news. While I have no idea if the enterprise applications they jointly develop will be any good, the bigger news to me is the extended and on-site support that IBM services will provide to businesses.

Microsoft is making great strides in services, while Apple is beginning to penetrate the corporate computing world more and more. It's a new world.
