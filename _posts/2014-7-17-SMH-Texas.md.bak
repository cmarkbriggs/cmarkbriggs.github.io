I really like how Texas operates, for the most part. A lot of the state's policies are really friendly to businesses. This is why their economy has been booming, even during the Obama recession. [This](http://www.dallasnews.com/investigations/watchdog/20140607-watchdog-drivers-license-centers-snatch-your-fingerprints.ece), however, is not cool.

> Quietly, earlier this year, the Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring full sets of fingerprints from everyone who obtains a new driverâ€™s license or photo identification card.

I understand the need to try and stop identity theft and terrorism, but treating everyone who's getting their driver's license renewed like a criminal is not the way to do it.
