Regardless of political ideology, I don't see how anyone can not be upset about the trade that took place for the release of Bowe Bergdahl. While it's always good to get a soldier home, I think this sets a dangerous precedent for negotiating with terrorists. The five most senior Taliban leaders were released in exchange for the return of one American soldier. Does this not tell terrorists in Afghanistan and other countries that they should capture American military members if we have someone in captivity that they want released?

Then there's the issue of Obama, once again, [doing an end-around Congress](http://blog.heritage.org/2014/06/02/q-need-know-bergdahl-release-deal/):

> The administration did not comply with the 30-day congressional notification requirement to transfer detainees from Guantanamo. Under Section 1035 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014, Congress placed certain restrictions on the transfer to foreign countries of individuals detained at Guantanamo. It requires the secretary of defense to notify the Armed Services, Appropriations and Intelligence Committees of the Senate and House not later than 30 days before the transfer of any such detainees.

But that's a law that Barry doesn't like. What does he do with laws he doesn't like? He [chooses to ignore them](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/12/26/statement-president-hr-3304):

> Section 1035 of this Act gives the Administration additional flexibility to transfer detainees abroad by easing rigid restrictions that have hindered negotiations with foreign countries and interfered with executive branch determinations about how and where to transfer detainees.

This administration has been bad news for the country from the outset. With the foreign policy disasters of the last couple of years, culminating with this release of five senior Taliban leaders, this administration is now a danger to this country.
