So President Obama hosted a summit on countering "violent extremism" this week. Well, I'm glad he's finally taking a [stand against ISIS by talking](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-obama-terrorism-conference-20150218-story.html#). Again.

> Efforts to counter violent extremism will only succeed if citizens can address legitimate grievances through the democratic process and express themselves through strong civil societies. Those efforts must be matched by economic, educational and entrepreneurial development so people have hope for a life of dignity.

You know, Lord forbid we actually fight back against these monsters. We must give them jobs. That'll stop them from becoming terrorists. Ugh.

Operation #Hashtag is in full effect.
