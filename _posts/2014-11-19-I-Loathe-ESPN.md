Well, another college basketball season has started. That means it’s that time of year when my visceral hatred of ESPN rears its ugly head. You see, I can’t watch many of the early season games of my beloved [Wolfpack](Wolfpack). Why? Because I have DirecTV.

I will not give up my DirecTV. I’ve had Time Warner Cable before, and their picture is horrible. There really isn’t much I don’t like about DirecTV. Except I can’t get ESPN3, and I don’t blame DirecTV for that at all.

I would gladly pay ESPN $5 per month or so just to get ESPN3. Not going to happen. I have been waiting for this situation to be resolved for years, and no resolution is in sight. Sigh.
