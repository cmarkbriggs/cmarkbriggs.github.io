As Microsoft's Office 365 becomes more and more popular, it's natural that hackers will target it more. [This article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-365-is-becoming-the-core-of-many-businesses-and-hackers-have-noticed/) talks about the growing number of sophisticated hacking operations that are increasingly targeting companies' cloud data, Office 365 in particular.

One of the first steps of any organization using Office 365, or Google's G Suite for that matter, should be to enable multi-factor authentication. In this day and age, MFA should be enabled whenever and wherever possible. Any time a web service I use starts offering MFA, I immediately enable it on my account.

Services like Office 365 and G Suite provide the tools necessary for robust security deployments and monitoring. It's just up to the organization to use them.
