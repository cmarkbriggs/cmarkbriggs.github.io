title: More of the â€œCarolina Way"

I grew up a Wolfpack fan. Both my parents went to N.C. State. I've always thought the "Carolina Way" was a bunch of bull. It was nothing but a way for UNC-CHeat people to brag about their holier-than-thouness. To add to their decades-long academic abuses, they proceeded to [sweep sexual misconduct cases under the proverbial rug](https://www.wral.com/feds-unc-ch-mishandled-campus-sex-assault-cases/17655649/).

> The findings by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which were issued Monday, follow a five-year investigation prompted by complaints from several women who said UNC-Chapel Hill underreported sex assaults in an annual report on campus crime and created a hostile environment for students trying to report an assault.

Given the lengths this university went to in academics to keep athletes eligible, it makes one wonder how many of these sexual assault cases were committed by athletes. Maybe one day we'll all find out.
