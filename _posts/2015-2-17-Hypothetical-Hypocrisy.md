I happened across a news story today that Apple had cut ties with a lobbyist from Alabama. The reason? He is not on the [“correct” side of the gay marriage issue](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/17/_n_6699054.html).

> In 2009, Love gained attention for sponsoring a resolution that praised Miss USA pageant contestant Carrie Prejean for speaking out against same-sex marriage.
>
> The year before, while running for Congress, Love aired an ad that touted his position against marriage equality: "Jay Love will stand up to the liberals and fight for what's right. He'll defend the unborn and traditional marriage."

Now, my issue is not to argue that what Apple did is wrong in cutting ties with this man. They’re entitled to work with whomever they see fit. However, let’s say some other company decided to cut ties with a person - lobbyist, designer, marketer, whatever - because they believed in and campaigned for gay marriage. What would the media and public reaction be?

It would be pure, unadulterated outrage. The company that did that would be berated, belittled, and boycotted. Why is it only okay to not work or do business with someone when they believe in traditional marriage?

In this land of free speech and thought, only one side of this issue is free to speak and think.
