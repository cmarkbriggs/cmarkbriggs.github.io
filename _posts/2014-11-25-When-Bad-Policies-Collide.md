title: When Bad Policies Collide

Obamacare is a horrible law. Obama’s amnesty, while not a law nor lawful, is terrible. Put the two together and what do you get? [Absurdity](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/25/obama-amnesty-obamacare-clash-businesses-have-3000/).

> President Obama’s temporary amnesty, which lasts three years, declares up to 5 million illegal immigrants to be lawfully in the country and eligible for work permits, but it still deems them ineligible for public benefits such as buying insurance on Obamacare’s health exchanges.

> Under the Affordable Care Act, that means businesses who hire them won’t have to pay a penalty for not providing them health coverage — making them $3,000 more attractive than a similar native-born worker, whom the business by law would have to cover.

I certainly hope that, once the new Republican controlled Senate convenes next year, Congress can undo some of the damage that Barack Obama has inflicted on this great nation.
