With the exception of the case allowing sales tax on internet sales to be collected, the Supreme Court has been knocking it out of the park lately with their decisions. Today, [they said that companies and government agencies cannot forcibly collect union dues from employees who chose not to be members of the union](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/27/gorsuch-in-union-ruling-tips-scales-on-another-landmark-case.html).

> The decision, which dealt a blow to unions, said that a union’s contract negotiations over pay and benefits were inextricably linked with its broader political activities, and concluded workers had a limited constitutional right not to underwrite such “speech.”

> The case specifically examined union fees paid by non-members.

> “The procedure violates the First Amendment and cannot continue,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. “Neither an agency fee nor any other payment to the union may be deducted from a nonmembers wages, nor may any other attempt be made to collect such a payment, unless the employee affirmatively consents to pay.”

To many, myself included, this is just common sense. Unions have run roughshod over works for long enough.
