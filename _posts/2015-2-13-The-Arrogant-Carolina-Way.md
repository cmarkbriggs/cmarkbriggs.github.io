So the North Carolina football team decided to celebrate after their victory over Duke in Durham last November 24. They did so by vandalizing the visitor’s locker room. This wasn’t just a few players gone wild. This was a lot of them, and under the supervision of at least some of the team’s staff.

To Duke’s credit, they decided to bill UNC for the $27,170.44 it took to repair the damages. The response from UNC Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham was characteristically [arrogant](http://www.newsobserver.com/2015/02/13/4553268_duke-billed-unc-2717044-for-paint.html?rh=1).

> “While I may not understand the charges assessed, we take complete responsibility for our students and our programs,” Cunningham wrote to White.

> To close his letter, Cunningham included a photo of spray paint damage to UNC’s South Building on campus – four pillars were tagged with the letters D-U-K-E on Feb. 19, 2014, before the Duke-UNC basketball game.

> “The University of North Carolina bore the cost of sandblasting these pillars and did not make public comments of the transgression. I acknowledge we have no idea who did this, but I simply included it to demonstrate that all fans, teams, coaches, students, etc. need to appreciate and respect the rivalry.”

First, I’m pretty sure the charges assessed are not difficult to comprehend, even for someone at Carolina. Second, you’re going to compare a random act of vandalism by unknown people to an act of vandalism performed by known members of your football team that occurred with members of the team’s staff looking on? Really?

It continues to astound me that, after all that has happened over the past few years at “The Flagship” - cheating, no-show classes, improper benefits - unbridled arrogance is still in abundant supply.
