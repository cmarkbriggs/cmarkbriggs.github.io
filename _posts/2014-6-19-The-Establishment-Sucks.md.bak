I cannot believe the [House elected Kevin McCarthy](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/19/kevin-mccarthy-elected-house-majority-leader/?page=2) to be the House Majority Leader. Instead of listening to the conservative base that voted out Eric Cantor, they choose to thumb their collective noses at all of us. This guy is more liberal than Cantor, and Cantor was far from conservative.

I am so ready for these clowns to be voted out, or at least be relegated to the minority portion of their own party in the House. The best thing to happen for this country would an influx of actual conservatives into both houses of Congress. If this country is going to be put back on track, we need a lot more Ted Cruz's.
