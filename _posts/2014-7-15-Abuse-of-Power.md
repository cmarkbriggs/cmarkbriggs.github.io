Yet another example of the Obama administration [abusing its power](http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska/justice-department-enters-fray-over-th-of-july-parade-float/article_3618cfc7-913b-5f4a-af50-348e48e76c5a.html%0A) because of Barry's thin skin.

> The U.S. Department of Justice has joined the discussions over a controversial float in the Norfolk Independence Day parade.

> The department sent a member of its Community Relations Service team, which gets involved in discrimination disputes, to a Thursday meeting about the issue. Also at the meeting were the NAACP, the Norfolk mayor and The Independent Order of Odd Fellows.

These same people had no problem with other leftists portraying George W. Bush as Hitler. To get the Justice Department involved in this is ludicrous.
