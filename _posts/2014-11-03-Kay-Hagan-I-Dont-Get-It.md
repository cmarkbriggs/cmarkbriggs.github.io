I cannot believe Kay Hagan is likely to keep her Senate seat in my home state of North Carolina. The only thing I can figure out is that those blatantly lying ads she has endlessly run on TV have had some effect.

Even so, I cannot fathom how a Senator [that funneled stimulus money to her husbandâ€™s company](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/north-carolina-investigating-kay-hagan-conflict-interest_817885.html) can get reelected.
