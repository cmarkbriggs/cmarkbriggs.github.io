That’s the stance liberals and the LGB community have taken in recent years. If you do not believe that homosexuality is okay, then you are a bigot. End of story.

The news that the city of Atlanta today [fired their Fire Chief](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/6/kelvin-cochran-atlanta-fire-chief-terminated-for-a/) is yet another sign of the Left’s inability to tolerate opposing views. This man wrote a religious book that condemned homosexuality and gave it to people with whom he thought he had established a “personal relationship with as Christians.” Oh, the horror!

What if he had been gay and given out a book explaining how “normal” homosexuality is? He would have been commended for his bravery and probably been given a raise.

I continue to be amazed at how the Left gets away with calling the Right intolerant. The truth lies exactly 180° the other direction.
