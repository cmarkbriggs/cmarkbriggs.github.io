On Saturday, at a rally in California, Maxine Waters [proceeded to encourage harassment](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/25/liberals-attack-bondi-sanders-trump-667934) against people of differing political views.

> "If you see anybody from that Cabinet — in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station — you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere."

Now, I don't take Maxine Waters seriously. She is a buffoon. However, a lot of people on the left do take her seriously. Because of that, talk like this coming from an elected official is dangerous. At some point, harassment is going to turn to violence.

Today, President Trump, in typical Trumpian fashion, [hit back at Mad Maxine](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1011295779422695424).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1011295779422695424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2018</a></blockquote>

Keep talking, Maxine. You're going to help get Trump re-elected.
