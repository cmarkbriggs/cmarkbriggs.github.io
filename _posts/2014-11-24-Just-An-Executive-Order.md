I’m not sure which is more shocking, the fact that a Saturday Night Live skit actually poked fun at an Obama policy or that it was funny. I still remember watching those Schoolhouse Rock videos during Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid. The “I’m Just a Bill” video was always my favorite, probably because the tune was just so darn catchy.
