So the Federal Trade Commission is [suing AT&T](http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/28/federal-trade-commission-suing-att-for-throttling-unlimited-data-user-speeds/) for throttling heavy data users on their unlimited plan. As happy as I have been with my AT&T service, I am glad to see this. Unlimited should mean unlimited.

I have been an unlimited customer since my first iPhone, the 3GS. However, as I am not a frequent traveler and am usually on a WiFi network, I don’t believe I’ve ever used enough data in a month to be throttled. This does come at a good time, though, as I am traveling more now, and faster LTE speeds make it easier to consume more bytes.

I sure hope that a win for the FTC doesn’t mean the end of unlimited data. That would be quite the bummer.
