title: Miss USA Starts a Feminist Firestorm

So, Miss Nevada was asked a question about sexual assaults on college campuses during the Miss USA pageant. [Her response](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/06/09/feminists-freak-out-over-miss-nevada-suggestion-women-learn-self-defense-n1849213) was a decent one:

 “I believe that some colleges may potentially be afraid of having a bad reputation and that would be a reason it could be swept under the rug, because they don’t want that to come out into the public,”Nia Sanchez said. “But I think more awareness is very important so women can learn how to protect themselves. Myself, as a fourth-degree black belt, I learned from a young age that you need to be confident and be able to defend yourself. And I think that’s something that we should start to really implement for a lot of women.”

This proceeded to freak out a bunch of feminists on Twitter:

> Miss Nevada👎 Sick of hearing "women need to learn selfdefense from sexual violence" We need a culture we don't have to defend ourselves from

Well, yeah, we could teach men to not rape at all. Then we could all get together and sing Kumbayah around the campfire while holding hands. This is something that liberals just can't, or won't, grasp:  Utopia does not exist. No one is promoting rape culture, but evil exists in this world. It always will.

Do these same feminists lock their car when they leave it? Shouldn't we just teach everyone to not steal? Do they lock their home when they leave it? Shouldn't we teach everyone that burglary is wrong? Why should law enforcement care about illegal drugs? Shouldn't we just teach people not to use illegal drugs?

The ridiculousness of the feminist argument in this case is its illogicality. Bad people are out there, and they're going to do whatever it is they're going to do regardless of what society says or promotes. Why wouldn't you want to be prepared?
