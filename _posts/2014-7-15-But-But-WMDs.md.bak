Would someone please tell me where in the world [these chemical weapons](http://apne.ws/1n58sWw) came from? I know they weren't already in Iraq. Everyone knows Iraq has never had weapons of mass destruction.

> The Islamic State extremist group has taken control of a vast former chemical weapons facility northwest of Baghdad, where remnants of 2,500 degraded chemical rockets filled decades ago with the deadly nerve agent sarin are stored along with other chemical warfare agents, Iraq said in a letter circulated Tuesday at the United Nations.

By the way, the rest of Saddam's WMDs are in Syria.
