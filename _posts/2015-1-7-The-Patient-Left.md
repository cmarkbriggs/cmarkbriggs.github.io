title: The Patient Left
---

I read the book ["Witness" by Whittaker Chambers](http://whittakerchambers.org/books/witness/) a few years ago. The book was about the rise of Communism in this country. A lot of it had to do with the case of Soviet spy Alger Hiss. What I took away from it was how dangerously patient Communists are, and their long-term plan for taking over this country.

While I don't believe they will ever succeed in taking over our great country, they have succeeded in one area: today's youth. They knew the best way to spread their influence in our country was through education. While communism has not gone away, in this country it has primarily morphed into liberalism. And the education system in this country is 100% liberal.

When I see what young people - not just young people I know, but young people in general - post on the internet, I see the fruits of those decades of patient planning and labor. The group-think among teenagers and millennials is scary. It really is.

There's a reason more young people tend towards liberalism. They're either in school or haven't been out for long, and the indoctrination from middle school/high school/college still has a hold. The liberal media plays a part as well, but they're just reinforcers of beliefs already held.

This sounds old, tired, and cliched, but I truly, genuinely weep for the future of this country.
