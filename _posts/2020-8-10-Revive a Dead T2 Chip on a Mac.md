title: Revive a Dead T2 Chip on a Mac
tags: technology apple
---

I came across [this support article](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-mac-firmware-apdebea5be51/mac) from Apple today. This is the first I've heard of the T2 security chip on the newer Macs ever becoming unresponsive. According to Apple, it is a very rare problem.

After reading this document, I believe I may have seen this problem a time or two at my last job. There was one MacBook in particular, a 2018 15" model, on which I could not reinstall MacOS to save my life. Nothing I tried worked. Now, I'm almost positive the T2 chip was the culprit.

Rare or not, I'm glad I came across this support document. It's a nice bit of information to have in the 'ol arsenal of knowledge.
