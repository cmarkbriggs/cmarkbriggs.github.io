It has been way too long since I have blogged on a regular basis. I happened to stumble across an article at lunch today about blogging with Jekyll. So, I thought this would be a great time to get back into blogging. In addition, I'm refreshing myself with Git again, as it's been quite a while since I've used it on a (semi) regular basis.

In addition to politics, a hobby of mine that consumes way too much of my time, I will share some computer-related posts with tips and tricks I've picked up along the road I've travelled to becoming more productive. There may be some sports thrown in here and there as well.

So sit back, relax, and welcome to the no-bull zone.
