This is the first year I really paid close attention to Apple's WWDC keynote speech. As an iPhone and iPad user for the last few years, I would read tech blogs for any news coming out of WWDC as it related to iOS. As a Mac user now, this year I was excited about the OS X news coming out of San Francisco. I was not disappointed.

The thing I'm most excited about is [Continuity](http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/mac-and-ios/). Being able to see incoming calls on my Mac, answer them, and even use my Mac as a speakerphone is something I am eagerly anticipating. Being able to sync SMS messages between devices is going to be very nice since there a still a few non-believers out there who text me.

As for the redesign of OS X, I was worried that Apple would make some drastic changes. However, that is [not the case](http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/design/). I do think the translucency of windows might become annoying, but maybe it will be subtle enough that it's not. We'll see. (Windows has had translucent windows for a long time - I guess it's okay when Apple copies Microsoft.)
