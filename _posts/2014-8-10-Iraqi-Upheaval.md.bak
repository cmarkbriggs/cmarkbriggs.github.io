I certainly hope [the coup currently happening in Iraq](http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/10/coup-underway-in-iraq/) doesn't interrupt Obama's vacation plans. Even with all the disturbing things this man has done while President of the United States, I am still finding it hard to believe how utterly detached he is with regards to the current happenings in the Middle East. At least fake it, Barack.

With ISIS currently terrorizing the country, I think this is not a particularly good time for the Iraqi government to have to undergo a transition. However, al-Maliki has had two terms as president. As the country is currently in dire straits, maybe a new government headed by a Kurd is just the thing Iraq needs. Well, that and a little help destroying those evil bastards of ISIS.
