Yesterday's [ruling by the patent office to revoke the trademark registration](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/us-patent-office-cancels-redskins-trademark-registration-says-name-is-disparaging/2014/06/18/e7737bb8-f6ee-11e3-8aa9-dad2ec039789_story.html?hpid=z1) of the name "Redskins" from the Washington Redskins invoked a really strong reaction from me yesterday. I really thought this was the first step of the government forcing Daniel Snyder to change the name of his team. After listening to the [Mark Levin Show](http://www.marklevinshow.com/), however, I feel much better about the situation.

It appears that not only is the ruling likely to be overturned on appeal, the loss of trademark registration is really not a huge factor with regards to merchandise sales. It seems that if someone were try to sell some Redskins merchandise without approval from the team, the team could bring a common law lawsuit. The Redskins would be assured of winning any such lawsuit.

No one uses this word as a disparaging, racist slur. No one has in over a century. The majority of Native Americans do not care about this issue. Hell, it was four Native Americans playing on the team in the early years that came up with the name "Redskins."

This is just one more example of liberals in government playing races against each other to further divide us. This is what they do. I also think it's one of the tried and true issues - at least in the last couple of years - they keep raising to distract from the truly serious and damaging controversies that keep cropping up during the worst Presidency in American history. I like to call them "Squirrel!!!" issues.
