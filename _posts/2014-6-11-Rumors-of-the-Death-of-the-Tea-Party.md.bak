...have been greatly exaggerated. Last night's [Republican primary defeat of Eric Cantor](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_VIRGINIA_PRIMARY_CANTOR?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-06-10-20-05-45) was a shockingly huge win for the Tea Party. Why the establishment Republicans in Washington insist on pushing for amnesty is beyond me. The majority of those illegal immigrants they're trying to woo are never going to vote for them. Period.

I love how all of these political consultants who orchestrated the losses of people like McCain and Romney keep telling us we must embrace immigration reform. I also love how they keep calling it immigration reform when what they actually mean is amnesty. I'm all for legal immigration reform, but the borders must be secured first. People such as myself are constantly labeled "anti-immigrant." No, we're "anti-illegal immigrant." There's a pretty significant difference.

Here's hoping David Brat is the first of a new wave of actual conservatives elected in the coming years. The country would be better off for it.
