I really do not understand the madness the left has espoused these last couple of days after the Supreme Court decided the Hobby Lobby case. There is so much misinformation being spewed from the left with regards to this case. Like so many things that upset the left, everything to do with this case seems perfectly logical to me.

The insurance Hobby Lobby provides its workers covers sixteen kinds of birth control. The suit was brought about because the Christian owners of Hobby Lobby did not want to offer the Plan B pill and the other three emergency contraceptive pills. Of course, it's the monstrosity known as Obamacare that mandates insurance cover these contraceptives. The fact that the owners of this company are religious and object to these contraceptive methods seems perfectly normal to me, as it should to any reasonable person.

Personally, I don't see why any medical insurance should cover any kind of birth control. It's not medically necessary, though I suppose for a some women the pill is prescribed to help with menstruation. Women have the option of not having sex if they don't want to get pregnant. Aside from that, they could pay for birth control if they want to copulate with the fear of pregnancy. Birth control is not expensive.

I can see some insurance plans offering to cover birth control as a part of better insurance plans. But required, as Obamacare mandates? That is absurd. But then, most of Obamacare is absurd. As a minor point, why doesn't Obamacare state that insurance plans must pay for condoms for men? If you're going to cover contraceptives for women, why not for men?

I'm going to have to make a trip to Hobby Lobby this weekend. Maybe I'll stop by Chick Fil-A on the way.
